page 37
line 1 : dataTree a=Empty|Branch a(Tree a) (Tree a)
line 2 : foldTree:: (e→a→a→a)→a→Tree e→a
line 3 : foldTree f z Empty=z
line 4 : foldTree f z(Branch x l r) =f x (foldTree f z l)
										 (foldTree f z r)
should the 'e' on line 2 not be an 'a' ? Since it should be the same type as the second 'x' on line 5 (and thoses 'x' are definde as 'a'-type on line 1)



Less relevant but i would like to know what the function sign does on page 42, I was unable to find it online.
